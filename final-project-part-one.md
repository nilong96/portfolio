# Outline

For my final project, the topic that I will be discussing is the issue of student loan. Student Loan is a prominent issue in our current society and there has not been a good solution to this issue. In my final project, I would like to show the trend and data of the student loan from 1960s to 2010s. In my storyboard, the data will be showing the trend of the student loan, together with the admission of the undergraduate student. I want to show the how the admission of undergraduate student, the tuition and financial aid is all interconnected. My call of action is to educate future prospective college student on how to wisely utilize student loan, and also promote policy where college is required to control their tuition inlation.


**Setup** : Undergraduate college student borrow student loan to attend college.

**Conflict**: Many graduate and current adults struggle in paying their student loan and maintaining their normal economic payment due to inflation.

**Resolution**: Educate prospective student on how to wisely utilize student loan and implementing policies on controlling tuition inflation and college cost transparency.
