# Outline

For my final project, the topic that I will be discussing is the issue of student loan. Student Loan is a prominent issue in our current society and there has not been a good solution to this issue. In my final project, I would like to show the trend and data of the student loan from 1960s to 2010s. In my storyboard, the data will be showing the trend of the student loan, together with the admission of the undergraduate student. I want to show the how the admission of undergraduate student, the tuition and financial aid is all interconnected. My call of action is to educate future prospective college student on how to wisely utilize student loan, and also promote policy where college is required to control their tuition inlation.


**Setup** : Undergraduate college student borrow student loan to attend college.

**Conflict**: Many graduate and current adults struggle in paying their student loan and maintaining their normal economic payment due to inflation.

**Resolution**: Educate prospective student on how to wisely utilize student loan and implementing policies on controlling tuition inflation and college cost transparency.


## Initial sketches
> Post images of your anticipated data visualizations (sketches are fine). They should mimic aspects of your outline, and include elements of your story.

# The data
> A couple of paragraphs that document your data source(s), and an explanation of how you plan on using your data. 

I will be utilizing several data for my final project. Two of my data was obtain from the datacommons, and the origins of the data in datacommons comes from census.gov. Other than data commons and census.gov, I also find several data from Kaggle and Tableau Public Datasources. By utilizing these data, I want to provide several perspective of how student loan is connected to university admission and financial aid. I will first use a broader spectrum of the data such as the amount of Student Loan and population of undergrad student as an introduction. In the middle of the story, I will funnel it down to one specific college, which is Yale University.

> A link to the publicly-accessible datasets you plan on using, or a link to a copy of the data you've uploaded to your Github repository, Box account or other publicly-accessible location. Using a data source that is already publicly accessible is highly encouraged.  If you anticipate using a data source other than something that would be publicly available please talk to me first.

# Method and medium
I plan to review the data further and only using variables that is useful for my final project. Tableau and Canva will be my main tools for data visualization. Additionally, I plan to use shorthand as my medium for my storyboard and presentation.
