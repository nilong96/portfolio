# The final data story
[Final Project](https://carnegiemellon.shorthandstories.com/the-student-loan-struggle/index.html) 

The link above is my completed project for Telling Stories with Data. The topic of my story is regarding the issue of Student Loan in United States.

# Changes made since Part II

After the completion of Part II, I reviewed all the interview notes and comment in order to proceed with my final project. I realized that my story arc was too vague after showing my work to my interviewee, and I took advice from the professor's comment on possibly focusing on student loan repayment issue. With that in mind, I decided the flow of my story would be Introduction of Tuition expense and student loan, then focus on the three main issue related to student loan repayment. The interview notes and comment really help a lot in narrowing down my story arc since I was struggling on how to arrange my story.

In Part II, part of the data visualization and datasets that I used was "CMU History Tuition Expense" and "Public vs Private Student Loan". However, I changed my mind and decided not to used those datasets after the interview. One of the interviewee commented that the CMU Tuition expense data viz was too narrow, and suggested that US national average tuition might be an better options. Additionally, two of my interviewee also commented that the "Public vs Private Student Loan" data visualization was confusing, and might not be useful in supporting my story arc. In response to these comments, I researched more and found the datasets on US national college university expenses which shows the history of tuition expense from 1960s to 2010s.

Other than the tuition expense datasets, I also took the advice of the professor and went on CFPB website to find more information regarding student loan complaints. On the website, it has detailed reports and datasets that record all the complaints that was submitted by the borrowers. I was able to utilize the reports and datasets from CFPB to identify main issue that borrowers encounter when they tried to repay their loans after graduation. Unfortunately, CFPB did not provide the datasets that was used in their reports, and so I was forced to recreate the visualization that they used through Canva. 

## The audience

The targeted audience for my final data story are individuals who has students loan that are struggling with their loan repayment. The insights from my interview and also the project feedback from my professor help with narrowing my focus and choosing my target audience. For the specific adjustment, I was in loss at first on how to arrange the story arc. However, my interviewee suggested that I can keep the introduction and slowly move down to the loan repayment issue, which is the main focus of my final data story. 

## Final design decisions

Regarding my design decision, I decide to make it more data viz focus rather than graphic. Unfortunately, there is not much graphic-intense pictures on student loan, so I decided to use more call out statistics and data viz for my data story. When creating my data story, I found that the call-out-statistics method is really useful since it is more stand out. This method make audience focus on the important data and isolate all the other unnecessary information. Throughout my data story, I also added some background photo so that it can act as a section divider. I believe that the background photo can prevent audience from getting tired on looking at all the graphs in my data story.

# Final thoughts


I believe my final data story went well. I showed my final data story to two of my interviewee and they provided positive feedback on the story arc and data visualizations. One of the interviewee also provided a small feedback on the legend of the visualization, which is super useful since I did not notice the issues. I was nervous if my data visualizations fit my story arc, and whether my idea was correctly presented to the audience.
