# Wireframes / storyboards
> Using your sketches developed last week, further develop your story outline and relevant components visually through the use of wireframing / storyboards. Using your outline as a guide, include high-fidelity, individual draft data visualizations of the critical elements of your story you want to share with your reader. Note: you can build these elements out directly in Shorthand this week if you wish.  Reminder: this template is intended to help, but it doesn't substitute for reading through the full homework assignment!  The assignment page on Canvas includes many important details for completing Part II of the final project.

# User research 

## Target audience
> Include your approach to identifying representative individuals, and who you hope to reach with your story. 

My approach to identifying representative individuals is by random sampling. I will be interviewing three individuals from my workplace and personal life. They might be someone who has student loans, or does not have student loans. However, I believe that it is important to reach different individuals with different situation and experience. This way, I will be able to see different perspective from two different side and create a better storyboard.

The target audience that I hope to reach are current university student and working adults who have student loan debt. The content of my story arc is focus on student loan, and it should resonate with many individuals in United States who are struggling with their student loan debt. With the rising of university tuition expense, many students are forced to take student loan in order to cover their financial difficulties. With the information and call of action, I hope that it can provide more insight and assistance to those individuals who are struggling with their student loan. 

Interviewee 1: Female, working adults, early 30s, does not have student loan. Surrounding friends has student loan.

Interviewee 2: Female, working adults, late 20s, do have student loans. has both federal and private student loan. 

Interviewee 3: Female, working adults. early 40s, have student loans and currently has a child.

| Questions               | Interview 1 (female, late 20s) | Interview 2 (female, early 30s) | Interview 3 (female, early 40s) |
|-------------------------|--------------------------------|-------------|-------------|
| Did data visualizations present the data clear? Is there anything you would want to change or do it differently | Graph 1 is easy to understand regarding the trend of the rising tuition expense. Graph 2 is slightly confusing regarding x-axis since there is no label. Additionally, it might be good to change the y-axis, making it all range. Graph 3: making it less wordy on the bottom, and possibly do away with the grant aid. | There is some confusion regarding visualization 3. The interviewee did not fully understand what ‘Total’ refer to. What does the total means? For visualization 3, is it necessary to include the graph of total grant aid? The interviewee understand the comparison the comparison between the private and public sector, but the grant aid bar graph is confusing. The grant aid bar graph is too distracting when the focus was on student loan.          | Graph 1 demonstrate that tuition fees is rising over the year. Graph 2 shows some depressing data, but it still presents the data which the interviewee was able to understand it easily. Graph 3: total grant aid is confusing. The grant aid is a little deceptive, because it doesn’t show the total amount of each student’s receiving. Delete the grant aid, just focus on student aid bar. |
| Is there any information that you wish to know or have when applying student loan and repaying it? | maybe getting a tuition expense trend of all US university. Additionally, maybe add something along the line where students are having issue finding jobs after graduation. Is the college education worth the means of borrowing student loan?  | not more data, but more personal experiences story to invoke emotion. Data and graphs are impersonal, not emotional impact. Also, it might be useful to create the structures and outline of the story.            |   See data or visualization such as interest rate for the loans. Does it show the loan is predatory? Arrange the graph presentation so that it is visually appealing and comfortable.    |
| Who do you think the intended audience is?   | potential college students, highschool seniors.         | 	It is for people who don’t have student loans. The interviewee also thought the intended audience is students who might have federal student loan now or will have it in the future.  Lastly, it might be advocate who want to forgive student loan.           |  someone who has student loan debt, and it is also an issue who has an wide range audience in age from lower 30s to 60s.            |
| can you tell me what the data is telling you? or any advice on the storyline?   | showing the trends of increasing college expenses, and student need to take more student loan for their college expenses.       |	Narrowing the story arc down from the beginning. For example, talk about one of the process (Student loan repayment issue) in the beginning to narrow It down and give a perspective.       |  If rearranging the graph, it will make it more clear. One more graph to go more into granular depth and details.        |
