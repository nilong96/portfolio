# Wireframes / storyboards
> Using your sketches developed last week, further develop your story outline and relevant components visually through the use of wireframing / storyboards. Using your outline as a guide, include high-fidelity, individual draft data visualizations of the critical elements of your story you want to share with your reader. Note: you can build these elements out directly in Shorthand this week if you wish.  Reminder: this template is intended to help, but it doesn't substitute for reading through the full homework assignment!  The assignment page on Canvas includes many important details for completing Part II of the final project.

# User research 

## Target audience
> Include your approach to identifying representative individuals, and who you hope to reach with your story. 

My approach to identifying representative individuals is by random sampling. I will be interviewing three individuals from my workplace and personal life. They might be someone who has student loans, or does not have student loans. However, I believe that it is important to reach different individuals with different situation and experience. This way, I will be able to see different perspective from two different side and create a better storyboard.

The target audience that I hope to reach are current university student and working adults who have student loan debt. The content of my story arc is focus on student loan, and it should resonate with many individuals in United States who are struggling with their student loan debt. With the rising of university tuition expense, many students are forced to take student loan in order to cover their financial difficulties. With the information and call of action, I hope that it can provide more insight and assistance to those individuals who are struggling with their student loan. 

Interviewee 1: Female, working adults, early 30s, does not have student loan. Surrounding friends has student loan.
Interviewee 2: Female, working adults, late 20s, do have student loans. has both federal and private student loan. 
Interviewee 3: Female, working adults. early 40s, have student loans and currently has a child.
